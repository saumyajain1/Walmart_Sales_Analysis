# Walmart_Sales_Analysis

A project to practice data loading, cleaning and analysis using SQL.

Have currently queried the Walmart Sales dataset to answer the following questions: 

-- 1. How many cities does Walmart have branches in, i.e. how many unique cities does the data have?

-- 2. In which city is each branch?

-- 3. What is the most common payment method?

-- 4. What are the monhtly total revenues?

-- 5. What is the most selling product line?

-- 6. What product line has the largest revenue?

-- 7. For product lines that sold more products than the average number of products sold per product line, add a column 'popularity' which states whether the product line is popular or not.

-- 8. How do sales vary by time of day for each branch?

More Advanced Querying coming soon!
